- 👋 Hi, I’m @PriyamBhalla
- 👀 I’m interested in Analytics and I love helping businesses and retail companies maximize their vast amount of data to help their business grow positively. I would love to help them overcome the challenges, assist businesses in finding insights and uncovering hidden values in data through storytelling that would help the Business to grow.
Business Analytics exists to help overcome challenges and hurdles in various aspects of Business. The process is to identify patterns in data, detect the problem and give action-driven solutions, My interest in solving problems allows me to approach my work with a Result oriented mindset.
I've had data analytics knowledge using Pandas Matplotlib, Numpy, Tableau, PowerBI amongst others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics
